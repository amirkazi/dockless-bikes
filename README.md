Dockless Bikes Project for Department of Innovation and Technology (DoIT) 
Done as Mayoral Fellow for City of Chicago Office of the Mayor primarily between June - August 2018, though future updates may be added.

Confidential data/information has been removed.

For reference: The South-Side Dockless Bikes Pilot was conducted by the Office of the Mayor in collaboration with CDOT, DoIT, and other partners for providing bike transportation to South Side residents.

This code in this repository performs two broad tasks:
- Analyzes data given by various bike companies during the pilot, for distance, time and other ride related information.
- Creates an ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) pipeline that takes data from provided sources, transforms them into relevant formats appropriate for use, and uploads transformed data to a postgres database.
